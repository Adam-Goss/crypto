# crypto
A Cyber Security MSc project that configures both an IPSec and Wireguard VPN to model how a company can secure remote worker access to internal resources through the public Internet. 

This model uses the [Netktit](https://github.com/netkit-jh]) virtual network modelling software as PoC. 

See "crypto-pma.pdf" for more information and a thorough walkthrough of resources.
